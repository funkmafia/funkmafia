# Zak the Full-Stack Developer | 

I’m on a mission to craft solutions that make life easier and more inspired. I’m currently deep in a full-time software engineering bootcamp with the development academy, building real-world SaaS tools across finance, productivity, language, and tech; by turning bold ideas into apps that _actually work_.

- React & Next.js 
- Tailwind CSS

### About Me

Ex-mortgage advisor **→** full-stack creator.  
When I’m not coding, I’m probably:

1 - Lifting in the gym  
2 - Hiking the peaks 
3 - Blending up wild smoothie combos
4 - Coding with an empire mindset
